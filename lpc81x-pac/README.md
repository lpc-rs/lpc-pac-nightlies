# lpc81x-pac
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to LPC81X-PAC peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].
Refer to the [documentation] for full details.

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies.lpc81x-pac]
version = "0.2.1"
features = ["lpc810"]
```
The `rt` feature is enabled by default and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.
To disable, specify `default-features = false` in `Cargo.toml`.
In your code:
```rust
use lpc81x_pac::lpc810;
let mut peripherals = lpc810::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpio = &peripherals.gpio;
```
